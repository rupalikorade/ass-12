        <p style="color: rgb(15, 174, 41); background:aquamarine;">
            Nature provides us with essentials like oxygen, food, water, shelter, and clothing.
             It is a beautiful tapestry of myriad hues, offering a habitat and means of survival 
             for all life forms. Hence, it is our duty to care for and conserve nature for the
              health and wellbeing of all.</p>
